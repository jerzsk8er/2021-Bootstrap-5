                        The precursor to Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 by pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman. In
                        order to capitalize on the growing popularity of comic books—especially those starring
                        superheroes—Goodman created Timely Comics. Timely’s first comic book was Marvel Comics no. 1
                        (cover
                        dated October 1939), which featured several superhero characters, most notably the Human Torch
                        and
                        the Sub-Mariner. Timely Comics introduced many superhero characters during comics’ “Golden Age”
                        in
                        the 1940s, most importantly Captain America, who first appeared in Captain America Comics no. 1
                        (March 1941). Timely characters were often portrayed as fighting against the Nazis and the
                        Japanese
                        even before the United States entered World War II. As the 1940s came to a close, superheroes
                        fell
                        out of vogue with comic book readers, and Timely canceled the last of its books in this genre in
                        1950. In 1951 Goodman formed his own distribution company, and Timely Comics became Atlas
                        Magazines.
                        Though there was a brief experiment in bringing back superheroes such as Captain America in
                        1953,
                        Atlas’s output was mostly in other genres such as humour, westerns, horror, war, and science
                        fiction.

                        In 1934, Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, a pulp writer and former cavalry officer, formed the
                        company National Allied Publications to produce the series New Fun Comics—the first ongoing
                        American comic book to feature completely new material. (Prior to New Fun, comic books consisted
                        mostly of reprinted newspaper strips.)


                        By 1937, though, Wheeler-Nicholson was in debt to his printer, Harry Donenfeld, right as
                        National Allied was looking to get a new book called Detective Comics off the ground. Donenfeld
                        and his accountant, Jack Liebowitz, came on as partners so Wheeler-Nicholson could publish the
                        new title—but to do so, they created a sister company, simply called Detective Comics, Inc.


                        Wheeler-Nicholson was soon pushed out altogether, and Donenfeld purchased National Allied’s
                        assets during a bankruptcy auction. This gave Donenfeld and Leibowitz full control over National
                        Allied and Detective Comics (including Superman's Action Comics), and in 1946, the two companies
                        officially merged to form National Comics Publications. All-American Publications, which the two
                        were also involved in, joined in the merger as well.
