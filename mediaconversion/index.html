                    Pfizer (PFE), BioNTech (BNTX) – The companies said studies showed that three doses of their Covid-19
                    vaccine
                    neutralized the omicron variant, while two doses still offered protection. Pfizer and BioNTech also
                    said
                    they’re continuing to work on an omicron-specific vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech came well off earlier
                    premarket lows on the news, with Pfizer up 1.4% and BioNTech trimming its loss to 1.5%.

                    Campbell Soup (CPB) – The food producer beat estimates by 8 cents with adjusted quarterly earnings
                    of 89
                    cents per share, although revenue was slightly below analyst forecasts. Campbell said demand remains
                    elevated for its products, and that it’s been able to moderate the impact of higher input costs
                    through
                    strong pricing and productivity improvements. The stock added 1.4% in the premarket.

                    Thor Industries (THO) – The recreational vehicle maker earned $4.34 per share for its latest
                    quarter,
                    well
                    above the $3.24 consensus estimate. Revenue was also above Wall Street forecasts amid continued
                    strong
                    demand. Thor jumped 6% in premarket trading.

                    Weber (WEBR) – The grill maker’s stock rose 1% in the premarket after it reported a
                    narrower-than-expected
                    loss for its latest quarter and beat Wall Street revenue forecasts. Weber lost 13 cents per share, 5
                    cents
                    less than analysts had anticipated.

                    Stitch Fix (SFIX) – Stitch was hammered by 23.9% in the premarket after issuing current-quarter
                    revenue
                    guidance and membership metrics that fell short of Wall Street forecasts. The online apparel
                    retailer
                    did
                    post a narrower-than-expected loss for its latest quarter and better-than-expected revenue, but not
                    enough
                    to sway investor concerns.

                    ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) – ChargePoint posted an adjusted loss of 14 cents per share for its
                    latest
                    quarter, 1 cent wider than anticipated, while the charging station network operator saw revenue
                    slightly
                    above estimates. The company did give stronger-than-expected current-quarter revenue guidance and
                    raised
                    its
                    full-year outlook. Despite the upbeat outlook, ChargePoint fell 2.7% in premarket trading.

                    PagerDuty (PD) – PagerDuty reported an adjusted quarterly loss of 7 cents per share, 2 cents
                    narrower than
                    analysts had predicted, while revenue topped Street forecasts. The maker of IT response software
                    also gave
                    better-than-expected current-quarter revenue guidance, and its stock surged 10.9% in premarket
                    action.
