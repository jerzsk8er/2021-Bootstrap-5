            Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:

            Pfizer (PFE), BioNTech (BNTX) – The companies said studies showed that three doses of their Covid-19 vaccine
            neutralized the omicron variant, while two doses still offered protection. Pfizer and BioNTech also said
            they’re continuing to work on an omicron-specific vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech came well off earlier
            premarket lows on the news, with Pfizer up 1.4% and BioNTech trimming its loss to 1.5%.

            Campbell Soup (CPB) – The food producer beat estimates by 8 cents with adjusted quarterly earnings of 89
            cents per share, although revenue was slightly below analyst forecasts. Campbell said demand remains
            elevated for its products, and that it’s been able to moderate the impact of higher input costs through
            strong pricing and productivity improvements. The stock added 1.4% in the premarket.

            Thor Industries (THO) – The recreational vehicle maker earned $4.34 per share for its latest quarter, well
            above the $3.24 consensus estimate. Revenue was also above Wall Street forecasts amid continued strong
            demand. Thor jumped 6% in premarket trading.

            Weber (WEBR) – The grill maker’s stock rose 1% in the premarket after it reported a narrower-than-expected
            loss for its latest quarter and beat Wall Street revenue forecasts. Weber lost 13 cents per share, 5 cents
            less than analysts had anticipated.

            Stitch Fix (SFIX) – Stitch was hammered by 23.9% in the premarket after issuing current-quarter revenue
            guidance and membership metrics that fell short of Wall Street forecasts. The online apparel retailer did
            post a narrower-than-expected loss for its latest quarter and better-than-expected revenue, but not enough
            to sway investor concerns.
