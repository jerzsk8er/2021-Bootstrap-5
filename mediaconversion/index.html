                Pfizer (PFE), BioNTech (BNTX) – The companies said studies showed that three doses of their Covid-19
                vaccine
                neutralized the omicron variant, while two doses still offered protection. Pfizer and BioNTech also said
                they’re continuing to work on an omicron-specific vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech came well off earlier
                premarket lows on the news, with Pfizer up 1.4% and BioNTech trimming its loss to 1.5%.

                Campbell Soup (CPB) – The food producer beat estimates by 8 cents with adjusted quarterly earnings of 89
                cents per share, although revenue was slightly below analyst forecasts. Campbell said demand remains
                elevated for its products, and that it’s been able to moderate the impact of higher input costs through
                strong pricing and productivity improvements. The stock added 1.4% in the premarket.

                Thor Industries (THO) – The recreational vehicle maker earned $4.34 per share for its latest quarter,
                well
                above the $3.24 consensus estimate. Revenue was also above Wall Street forecasts amid continued strong
                demand. Thor jumped 6% in premarket trading.

                Weber (WEBR) – The grill maker’s stock rose 1% in the premarket after it reported a
                narrower-than-expected
                loss for its latest quarter and beat Wall Street revenue forecasts. Weber lost 13 cents per share, 5
                cents
                less than analysts had anticipated.

                Stitch Fix (SFIX) – Stitch was hammered by 23.9% in the premarket after issuing current-quarter revenue
                guidance and membership metrics that fell short of Wall Street forecasts. The online apparel retailer
                did
                post a narrower-than-expected loss for its latest quarter and better-than-expected revenue, but not
                enough
                to sway investor concerns.

                ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) – ChargePoint posted an adjusted loss of 14 cents per share for its latest
                quarter, 1 cent wider than anticipated, while the charging station network operator saw revenue slightly
                above estimates. The company did give stronger-than-expected current-quarter revenue guidance and raised
                its
                full-year outlook. Despite the upbeat outlook, ChargePoint fell 2.7% in premarket trading.

                <!--PagerDuty (PD) – PagerDuty reported an adjusted quarterly loss of 7 cents per share, 2 cents narrower than
                analysts had predicted, while revenue topped Street forecasts. The maker of IT response software also gave
                better-than-expected current-quarter revenue guidance, and its stock surged 10.9% in premarket action.

                Toll Brothers (TOL) – Toll Brothers earned $3.02 per share for its latest quarter, compared with a consensus
                 estimate of $2.49, while the luxury home builder also reported better-than-expected revenue. It is also
                 projecting 20% growth in fiscal 2022 revenue as demand remains elevated. Toll added 1.5% in the premarket.

                 Robinhood (HOOD) – Robinhood filed to terminate a planned share sale by backers of the trading platform
                 company. The stock jumped 3% in the premarket.

                 BlackRock (BLK) – The asset management firm is pulling about $2 trillion of assets from State Street (STT),
                 which had served as the sole custodian of BlackRock’s ETFs. BlackRock will be shifting some of its ETF
                 custodianship to Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and BNY Mellon (BK).

                 Dave & Buster’s (PLAY) – Dave & Buster’s beat estimates by 8 cents with a quarterly profit of 23 cents per
                 share, while the operator of entertainment center-themed restaurants also saw revenue come in above Street
                 forecasts. Dave & Buster’s rallied 4.5% in the premarket. -->
